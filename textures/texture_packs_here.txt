Add your texture packs to this directory.

Texture packs modify the look of the game by replacing textures with your own versions.

Texture pack format:
- Create a folder in this directory
- Add your textures in PNG format 
- Add a texture_pack.conf file with metadata like title and description
- Optionally add a screenshot.png preview image

Example texture_pack.conf:
```
title = High Resolution Pack
description = Makes the game look fancy with higher res textures
author = Your Name
release = 1 
```
